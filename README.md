# "Would you rather" app

## Project:

This is Second project in one the final projects from Udacity's React Nano-Degree program. This app is built using react and redux. React-Bootstrap components are also used in this app.

This is a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option One] or [option Two] ?”. User select any of the option. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In this app, users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users in the leaderboard.
